## !!!Warning!!!

This was built in a hackathon race with @edenvicary, and as such the practices in use in this code base are for very short term speed, and as a result it is very bad code.

Some performance optimisations have been taken to increase speed / remove bugs but otherwise the code is terrible.

## Setup

Dependencies: nodejs

```
npm install
```

## Running

```
npm start
```
